# Claude Whisperer

Voice mode for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) on Apple Silicon. Talk to Claude, hear Claude talk back — all running locally on your Mac.

## How It Works

```
You speak -> Whisper (STT) -> Claude Code -> [VOICE: tag] -> Kokoro (TTS) -> You hear
```

1. **You speak** — transcribed locally by Whisper on Apple Silicon via MLX
2. **Claude responds** — full detailed text on screen as usual
3. **Claude adds a `[VOICE: ...]` tag** — a short conversational summary
4. **The hook extracts it** — sends only the spoken summary to Kokoro TTS
5. **You hear the response** — natural speech, fully async, interruptible

## Features

- 100% local — no cloud APIs, no data leaves your Mac
- Async playback — keep working while Claude speaks
- Interruptible — new responses cut off old audio
- Smart summaries — Claude generates spoken summaries, not raw text dumps
- Fallback mode — works even without the `[VOICE:]` tag (strips markdown, truncates)

## Requirements

- macOS with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) CLI or VS Code extension
- `jq` (install via `brew install jq`)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/PerIPan/Claude-Whisperer.git
cd Claude-Whisperer

# Install (creates venv, downloads models)
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# Start servers
./servers/start-servers.sh
```

## Setup

### 1. Run the setup script

```bash
./setup.sh                          # default venv: ~/mlx-openai-whisper
./setup.sh /path/to/custom/venv     # custom location
```

This installs all MLX dependencies including Whisper, Kokoro TTS, and spaCy.

### 2. Start the servers

```bash
./servers/start-servers.sh
```

This launches:
- **Port 8000** — Whisper STT (speech-to-text)
- **Port 8100** — Kokoro TTS (text-to-speech)

### 3. Configure Claude Code

Copy `CLAUDE.md` to your project root:

```bash
cp CLAUDE.md /path/to/your/project/
```

Add the hook to your `.claude/settings.json` (global or project):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/path/to/Claude-Whisperer/hooks/tts-hook.sh",
            "timeout": 60
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 4. Speech Input (STT)

**Option A: [Voquill](https://github.com/nicobailey/Voquill) (Recommended — open source)**

Voquill is an open-source macOS speech input app that works system-wide. Best dictation UX — works with any app including Claude Code.

**Option B: Whisper Voice Input (Best accuracy)**

Uses your local Whisper server. Much better than macOS dictation for technical terms, code, and non-English languages. Runs as a background service in a separate terminal:

```bash
# Start voice input (keeps listening, types text)
./scripts/start-input-voice-whisper.sh

# Say "submit", "send it", or "go ahead" at the end to press Enter

# Options:
./scripts/start-input-voice-whisper.sh --submit      # always auto-press Enter
./scripts/start-input-voice-whisper.sh --silence 2.5  # adjust silence detection
```

> Requires Accessibility permission for Terminal/VS Code (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility). One-time setup.
> Only types into allowed apps (Terminal, VS Code, iTerm2, Warp) — won't send text to wrong windows.

**Option C: macOS Dictation (Zero setup fallback)**

Press **fn fn** (fn key twice) to dictate. Works instantly, no extra scripts needed. Text appears in the Claude Code input field — review it, then press Enter.

> **Note:** The VS Code Speech extension (`ms-vscode.vscode-speech`) does **not** work with Claude Code's chat panel, as it uses a custom UI component.

## Configuration

Environment variables to customize behavior:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TTS_URL` | `http://localhost:8100/v1/audio/speech` | TTS server endpoint |
| `TTS_VOICE` | `af_heart` | Kokoro voice name |
| `TTS_MODEL` | `prince-canuma/Kokoro-82M` | TTS model |
| `STT_PORT` | `8000` | Whisper server port |
| `WHISPER_MODEL` | `mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo` | Whisper model |

## How the VOICE Tag Works

Claude includes a `[VOICE: ...]` tag at the end of every response:

```
Here's the full technical explanation with code...

[VOICE: I fixed the authentication bug. It was a missing token refresh in the middleware.]
```

- You **see** the full response on screen
- You **hear** only the conversational summary
- No extra LLM needed — Claude generates the summary itself

## Troubleshooting

**No audio output:**
- Check TTS server is running: `curl http://localhost:8100/models`
- Check `jq` is installed: `which jq`
- Test manually: `echo "hello" | ./scripts/speak.sh`

**422 error from TTS:**
- Make sure `model` field is included in requests
- Install spaCy model: see setup.sh

**Very short audio (millisecond):**
- The hook might be matching a literal `[VOICE: ...]` mention in text
- This is handled by using `tail -1` to grab the last match

**Voice input "osascript not allowed" error:**
- The voice input script uses AppleScript to type into the active app
- Grant **Accessibility** access: **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**
- Toggle on **Terminal** and/or **Visual Studio Code** (whichever runs the script)
- This is a one-time macOS permission — required for any app to send keystrokes

**Voice input picks up TTS audio (feedback loop):**
- Auto-pause is built in — the mic automatically pauses while TTS is playing
- If you still hear feedback, use headphones or lower speaker volume
- Or run with `--no-submit` to review before sending: `python scripts/voice-input.py --loop --no-submit`
