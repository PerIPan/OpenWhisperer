# Claude Whisperer

## What It Does

You use Claude Code normally. After every response, Claude's answer is automatically spoken aloud through your Mac's speakers using a local TTS model. For speech input, press **Ctrl** to record and release to transcribe — text is typed directly into your focused app.

Everything runs on your Mac — no cloud APIs, no data leaves your machine.

## Install

[**Download ClaudeWhisperer-1.2.1.dmg**](https://github.com/PerIPan/Claude-Whisperer/releases/download/v1.2.1/ClaudeWhisperer-1.2.1.dmg) — drag to Applications and launch.

On first launch, the app:
- Creates a Python environment with all dependencies
- Downloads MLX Whisper (~1.5GB) and Kokoro TTS (~300MB) models
- Starts the unified server automatically

The menubar icon gives you:
- Start/Stop/Restart server with configurable port
- **Push-to-Talk** — hold Ctrl to record, release to transcribe and type into focused app
- **Language selector** — set STT language to avoid hallucinations in other languages (auto-detect or pick from 17 languages)
- **Voice picker** — choose from 8 Kokoro voices (no server restart needed)
- **Automation** — Auto-Submit and Auto-Focus (requires Accessibility permission)
- **Auto-Apply** — one-click setup for Claude hook (settings.json) and voice tag (CLAUDE.md)
- **Diagnostic checklist** — shows hook, voice tag, and TTS status at a glance
- **Transcription overlay** — floating window showing live waveform and recent transcriptions
- **Events log** — diagnostic log for troubleshooting paste and transcription issues
- Unified server log (STT + TTS on single port, includes transcribed text)

After setup, use the menubar buttons for configuration instructions.

## Push-to-Talk Dictation

Built-in speech-to-text using your local Whisper server. Press **Ctrl** to start recording, press again to stop — transcribed text is typed directly into whatever app you have focused.

### How It Works

1. Press **Ctrl** — recording starts (red indicator in menubar and overlay)
2. Speak your message
3. Press **Ctrl** again — audio is sent to local Whisper for transcription
4. Transcribed text is inserted into the focused app via Accessibility (native apps) or clipboard paste (all others)

</p>

### Requirements

- **Microphone permission** — macOS will prompt on first use
- **Accessibility permission** — required for typing text into other apps. Grant in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility

> **Note:** After rebuilding from source, you must remove and re-add the app in Accessibility settings (macOS caches the code signature).

### Automation

Both features are in the **Automation** section of the menubar and require **Accessibility permission** (macOS will prompt you on first use).

#### Auto-Submit

Enable **Auto-Submit** to submit messages by voice. Say one of these trigger words at the end of your phrase:

- "submit", "send", "send it", "go ahead", "enter"

Example: *"fix the login bug, submit"* → types "fix the login bug" and presses Cmd+Enter.

**Barge-in:** Any currently playing TTS audio is automatically interrupted when you start recording (press Ctrl) or when Auto-Submit triggers, so you can speak without waiting for Claude to finish talking.

#### Auto-Focus

Enable **Auto-Focus** to automatically bring a specific app to the front when you finish speaking. Pick from the dropdown (VS Code, Code Insiders, Cursor, Windsurf, Terminal, iTerm2, Warp, Alacritty, Ghostty) or select **Custom** to type any app name.

### Fallback: macOS Dictation

If you prefer not to grant Accessibility permission, press **fn fn** to use built-in macOS dictation. Less accurate for technical terms, but works instantly with zero setup.

## How the VOICE Tag Works

Claude adds a `[VOICE: ...]` tag at the end of every response:

```
Here's the full code with detailed explanation...

[VOICE: I added the login endpoint. It validates the email and returns a JWT token.]
```

- **Screen**: You see the full detailed response
- **Speakers**: You hear only the short spoken summary
- The hook script extracts the tag, sends it to Kokoro TTS, and plays the audio
- If there's no `[VOICE:]` tag, the hook falls back to stripping markdown and reading the raw text (truncated to ~600 chars)

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Used by | Description |
|----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `TTS_URL` | `http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/speech` | tts-hook.sh | Unified server TTS endpoint |
| `TTS_VOICE` | `af_heart` | tts-hook.sh | Kokoro voice name |
| `TTS_MODEL` | `prince-canuma/Kokoro-82M` | tts-hook.sh | TTS model |
| `SERVER_PORT` | `8000` | unified_server.py | Server port |
| `WHISPER_MODEL` | `mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo` | unified_server.py | Whisper model |

> **Tip:** Setting a specific language (e.g. English) instead of auto-detect prevents Whisper from hallucinating text in other languages during silence or background noise.

## Troubleshooting

**No audio after Claude responds:**
1. Check TTS server is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/models`
2. Test TTS directly: `echo "hello" | ./scripts/speak.sh`
3. Check the hook path in `settings.json` is correct and absolute

**Push-to-talk not typing text:**
1. Check Accessibility permission is granted in System Settings
2. If rebuilt from source, remove and re-add the app in Accessibility settings
3. Check Events Log in the menubar for diagnostic details

**422 error from TTS:**
- Make sure `model` field is included in requests
- Run `./setup.sh` again to reinstall spaCy model

## Manual Setup (from source)

> **Tip:** You can ask your AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to run these steps for you. Just paste the section below into your AI chat.

### Prerequisites

- Mac with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) (CLI or VS Code extension)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) — install with one of:
  ```bash
  # Option A: Direct download (no package manager needed)
  curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/jq https://github.com/jqlang/jq/releases/download/jq-1.7.1/jq-macos-arm64 && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/jq

  # Option B: Homebrew (if you have it)
  brew install jq
  ```

### Step 1: Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PerIPan/Claude-Whisperer.git
cd Claude-Whisperer
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```

This creates a Python venv at `~/mlx-openai-whisper` and installs everything (MLX Audio, Whisper, Kokoro TTS, spaCy).

### Step 2: Start the servers

```bash
./servers/start-servers.sh
```

One unified server starts on:
- `localhost:8000` — Whisper STT + Kokoro TTS (both on one port)

Keep this terminal open while using Claude.

### Step 3: Tell Claude to speak

Copy the `CLAUDE.md` file into any project where you want voice mode:

```bash
cp CLAUDE.md ~/my-project/
```

This tells Claude to add a `[VOICE: ...]` tag to every response with a short spoken summary.

### Step 4: Add the TTS hook

Add this to your `~/.claude/settings.json` (or your project's `.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/absolute/path/to/Claude-Whisperer/hooks/tts-hook.sh",
            "timeout": 60
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `/absolute/path/to/Claude-Whisperer` with where you cloned the repo (e.g. `/Users/yourname/Claude-Whisperer`).

### Building the App from Source

```bash
cd app
chmod +x build-dmg.sh
./build-dmg.sh
```

Requires Xcode Command Line Tools. Produces `Claude Whisperer.app` and `ClaudeWhisperer-1.2.1.dmg` in `app/.build/`.
